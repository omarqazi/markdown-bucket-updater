# Markdown Bucket Updater

Markdown bucket updater is a pretty simple. It's a process that is designed to run continuously (or just once if you want) and poll the contents of an S3 bucket filled with markdown files. It then generates HTML for those markdown files and uploads them to another S3 bucket, if changed.

I'm planning on using this in production, and I'll update this README with instructions on how to use this when I finish.
